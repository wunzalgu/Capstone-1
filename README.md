Big Mountain Resort is located in northwestern Montana. It offers spectacular views of Glacier National Park and Flathead
National Forest. The resort originally opened in 1947 with an annual snowfall of 333
inches and 3,000 acres of skier and rider accessible terrain. Big Mountain Resort offers
access to 105 named trails and vast bowl and tree skiing. All these are serviced by 11
lifts, 2 T-bars and 1 magic carpet for novice skiers. The longest run is named Hellfire
and is 3.3 miles in length. The base elevation is 4,464 feet, and the summit is 6,817 feet
with a vertical drop of 2,353 feet.


Big Mountain Resort has recently installed an additional chair lift to help increase the
distribution of visitors across the mountain. This additional chair increases their
operating costs by $1,540,000 this season. Every year about 350,000 people ski or
snowboard at Big Mountain. This business profit margin is 9.2% and the investors would
like to keep it there. The business is eager to get recommendations on recouping
the increased operating costs from the new chair this season.
